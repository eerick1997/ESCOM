-- Purpose:    
--     This VHDL netlist is a verification model and uses simulation 
--     primitives which may not represent the true implementation of the 
--     device, however the netlist is functionally correct and should not 
--     be modified. This file cannot be synthesized and should only be used 
--     with supported simulation tools.
